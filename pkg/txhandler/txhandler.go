// Transaction Handler owns the lifecycle of ManagedTransaction records
// Transaction Manager delegates all transaction specific operations to transaction apart from the triggers (REST API call for actions,
// Event stream for events) of those operations. This design allows the Transaction Handler to apply customized logic at different stages
// of transaction life cycles.
// The Transaction Handler interface consists of x important responsibilities:
// 1. Functions for handling its own lifecycle. (e.g. Init, Start)
//
//  2. Functions for handling events:
//     When implementing functions in this category, developers need to keep concurrency in mind. Because multiple invocations of a single
//     function can be process in parallel in any given time, it's recommended to use channels to ensure they are not blocking each other.
//     - inbound events: these events are received by transaction handler
//     a. instructional events: transaction handler need to implement the logic to make those event happen on blockchain. (e.g. creating
//     a new transaction)
//     b. informational events: transaction handler need to update its own record when an event has already happened to a related
//     blockchain transaction of its managed transaction
//     - outbound events: these events are emitted by transaction handler. apitypes.ManagedTransactionEventType contains a list of
//     managed transaction events that can be emitted by transaction handler.
